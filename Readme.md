# Crazy Rock-Paper-Scissors Implementations

## Please add your own solutions

### Rules

1. All PRs that pass the tests and are not copies accepted
1. Solutions must implement the [IGame](src/rock/paper/scissors/IGame.java)
1. Solutions must be added in a new package explaining their schtick, the [IGame](src/rock/paper/scissors/IGame.java) implementation should be named the same but in camelCase
1. Be creative, as simple as Rock-Paper-Scissors is Java cannot do an easy comparison
1. All new implementations must be registered in the [TestRegistry](test/rock/paper/scissors/TestRegistery.java) 
1. No new imports in [TestRegistry](test/rock/paper/scissors/TestRegistery.java) everything must be fully qualified or the PR will be rejected
1. [TestRegistry](test/rock/paper/scissors/TestRegistery.java) is the only file that may be changed
1. The [GameTest](test/rock/paper/scissors/GameTest.java) must not be changed
1. No other packages can be changed
1. Gradle dependencies are allowed, but may be rejected
1. It is encouraged to use the the [Constansts](src/rock/paper/scissors/Constants.java) for readability 

### Awards
1. Awards are subjective and final and unknown
1. No cash money or other compensation, however the winners will be known far and wide, just maybe not in the way they wanted
1. 7 > Java < 17 will get bonus points
